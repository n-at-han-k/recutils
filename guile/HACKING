* How to develop libguile-recutils

If you use Emacs and Geiser (highly recommended), your best
bet for interactive development is to start a REPL like this

    ./pre-inst-env guile --listen

and then `M-x connect-to-guile' and specify localhost. This way your Guile
process has the correct load path for extensions set, since that cannot be
easily customized.
